# aiode-prompter

my friends want it to be easier to make commands for our discord bot.

## how to get started

download index.html. click on it. it will open in your browser. bookmark it if you want. if you want something to work or look different lmk.

## how to use

now that you have it open:

1. THINK with your brain of a song you wanna hear
2. LOOK on spotify or youtube for a link to a track/album/playlist. or if spotify, skip this and just think of something you'd search there
3. COPY the link to whatever you found. skip this if you did the no link think thing.
5. PASTE what you copied into the text box on the `aiode-prompter` page in your browser
6. SELECT whether it's for spotify (link or search query) or youtube (link)
7. CLICK the button that says "tell aiode"
8. CLICK (again) but this time, the button that looks like a little clipboard icon. now it's on your clipboard!
9. PASTE it into discord. preferably the #bot-spam channel.
